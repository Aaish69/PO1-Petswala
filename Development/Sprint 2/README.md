ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

<Any additional information that you would like me to know>

1. During Development of functionalites in sprint 2, although it seems like repeated work, but it took a lot of time to build the first signup structure in sprint 2 as it was totally different from previous sign ups and it required additional feature of admin's aproval to be completed. And the email confirmation script also consumed so much time as django's built in email service could not been used for a user model that we created other than the abstract one. In conclusion, although it seems very little work done, but it took considerable hardwork.

2. In our feb-11 biweekly meeting, you asked us to integrate admin's panel into our website rather than using django's provided one. After our research, we found out that many notable companies (like ElevateSecurity) using django framework actually prefer django's admin interface as it provides more functionality and security so we did not work on this. Although, if it is still something that you want us to do, then we can surely do it in next sprint.

3. As discussed in last (feb-11) biweekly meeting, We had deployed the sprint 1 on online hosting platform but did not attach link in readme file so we did not receive any deployment marks. It can be fact checked that we actually deployed sprint 1 by looking at video presentation of Sprint 1 in which www.petswala.site is used to demonstrate the functionality. So we kindly request to give us marks for deployment in sprint 1.

4. We got 10/30 in work completed section in sprint 1, however we delivered what we promised in github project planner which was approved by you. So we kindly request you to review these marks.
